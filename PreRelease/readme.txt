> PROBLEM : GAME DOESN'T START OR CRASHES EARLY!
If the game doesn't start or crash when you start a new game try the following steps one by one.

1. Run Rogue Survivor configuration program (RSConfig.exe).
   Try different combinations of Video and Sound options, Save&Exit and start the game at each try.
   "Managed DirectX" as Video or Sound is likely be the source of the crash.
   Try "GDI+" for Video and/or "SFML" for Sound.

2. (Vista/Win7) Run the game as administrator.
   
If the game still doesn't work properly, you might need to update some system files.   
Restart your computer after each install.

1. Update your DirectX installation.
   Download "DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer" from Microsoft here:

If you tried the previous solutions and the game still crashes it should show you a game log.
You also have a logfile "log.txt" created in your Rogue Survivor folder.
Send me that log file at my email below.
You can also send the last save file.
You can also mail me if you think you spotted a bug that didn't crash your game.
