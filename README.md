========

Please note a recent reversion in the release format.  To accommodate incremental upgrades for players with weak Internet connections, binary-only and media-only ZIPs that are not intended to be playable out of the box are being provided for the unstable releases starting with 2018-04-04.

First installs on a machine should use a complete ZIP archive.  If the media archive matching a binary archive does not exist (e.g., 2018-04-07 has no media-only archive), there has been no change since
the most recent media-only archive -- and the binary-only archive is sufficient to upgrade.
